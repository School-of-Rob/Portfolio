# ExtraaLearn Potential Customers

This repository contains an academic project for the "Potential Customers" case study, completed as part of the Data Science program at Great Learning, and coded in Google Colab.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze lead data for ExtraaLearn, an EdTech startup, and build machine learning models to identify which leads are most likely to convert to paid customers. The project also aimed to uncover the key factors driving lead conversion and to create actionable profiles of high-potential leads.

## Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration:** Checked for missing values, dropped unnecessary columns, and performed sanity checks.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated relationships between features and conversion status using visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing:** Encoded categorical variables, scaled features, and handled outliers.
- **Model Building:** Built and evaluated Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, including hyperparameter tuning and pruning.
- **Feature Importance:** Identified and visualized the most influential features for lead conversion.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provided recommendations for improving lead conversion based on model findings.

## Notes

- This was an academic project, and some tasks and analyses were intentionally repeated as required by the assignment instructions.
- The analysis and recommendations are for educational purposes and may not reflect real-world business constraints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Robert Hilario Potential Customers.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis, modeling, and visualizations.

## Data

The dataset contains anonymized lead information, including demographics, interaction history, and conversion status.
