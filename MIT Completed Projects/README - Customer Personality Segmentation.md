# Customer Personality Segmentation

This repository contains an academic project for the Customer Personality Segmentation case study, completed as part of the Data Science program at Great Learning, and coded in Google Colab.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze customer data from a retail company and segment the customer base using machine learning techniques. The segmentation was based on customer demographics, personality traits, and purchasing behaviors, with the goal of providing actionable business insights for targeted marketing and improved customer retention.

## Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted categorical variables to numerical format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed univariate and bivariate analysis using histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Feature Engineering:** Standardized features and prepared the dataset for clustering.
- **Clustering:** Used K-Means clustering, including elbow and silhouette methods to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Cluster Profiling:** Analyzed and visualized clusters using boxplots and barplots to interpret key characteristics.
- **Business Recommendations:** Provided actionable insights based on cluster profiles.

## Notes

- This was an academic project and, as such, includes some repetitive tasks and code as required by the assignment instructions.
- The analysis and recommendations are for educational purposes and may not reflect real-world business constraints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Robert Hilario Customer Personality Segmentation.ipynb`.
2. Follow the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains anonymized customer information, including demographics, spending patterns, and campaign responses.
