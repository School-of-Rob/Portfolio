# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Notebook

This notebook analyzes the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, aiming to predict which passengers survived the disaster. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.
- **Modeling:** Building and tuning Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing models with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
- **Feature Importance:** Identifying key predictors of survival.
- **Prediction & Validation:** Generating predictions for all passengers and comparing them to actual survival outcomes for accuracy benchmarking.

## Recent Updates (August 12, 2025)
- Re-pruned and re-tuned Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
- Improved Random Forest accuracy from 88.44% to 89.56% against actual Titanic survival data.

## Usage

1. Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
2. Update file paths in the notebook to match your local environment.
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce results and generate predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Output

- Model predictions saved as CSV files.
- Accuracy comparison with actual survival records.
