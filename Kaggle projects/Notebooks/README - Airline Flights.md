# Airline Flight Data Visualizations

This notebook focuses on creating comprehensive data visualizations to explore airline flight patterns, pricing trends, and market dynamics. Using a dataset of 300,000+ flight records, the analysis is guided by specific questions to demonstrate various visualization techniques and uncover insights about the airline industry.

## Visualization Techniques Demonstrated

- **Bar Charts & Histograms:** Flight frequency by departure/arrival times and city distributions
- **Box Plots:** Price variations across airlines and seat classes
- **Categorical Plots:** Multi-variable relationships using color-coding (hue)
- **Line/Bar Charts:** Temporal pricing patterns based on booking timing

## Key Analysis Questions

1. **Airline Market Share:** Frequency distribution of airlines in the dataset
2. **Temporal Patterns:** Departure and arrival time distributions
3. **Geographic Analysis:** Source and destination city popularity
4. **Pricing by Carrier:** How ticket prices vary across different airlines
5. **Time-Based Pricing:** Price fluctuations by departure/arrival times
6. **Route-Based Pricing:** Price variations across city pairs
7. **Booking Timing Impact:** Price changes based on advance booking period
8. **Class-Based Pricing:** Business vs. Economy fare comparisons
9. **Specific Route Analysis:** Targeted pricing for Vistara Delhi-Hyderabad Business Class

## Key Insights

- **Vistara** dominates market share (127K+ flights) but commands highest prices
- **AirAsia** offers the most budget-friendly options
- **Red-eye flights** (late night departures) are significantly cheaper
- **Last-minute bookings** (1-2 days) result in premium pricing
- **Business Class** tickets are substantially more expensive than Economy

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- scipy, scikit-learn

## Dataset

- 300,153 flight records
