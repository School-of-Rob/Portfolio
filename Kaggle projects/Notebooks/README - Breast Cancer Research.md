# Breast Cancer Research - Machine Learning Notebook

This notebook explores factors contributing to malignant breast tumors using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wasiqaliyasir/breast-cancer-dataset). The workflow includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
- **Model Building:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (with pruning), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning).
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance for each model.
- **Insights:** Comparison of model performance and identification of top predictive features.

EDA code written manually. Modeling code was AI-assisted. Tweaks to all code made manually. Completion time: Less than one hour. 
Completion time: Less than one hour.
